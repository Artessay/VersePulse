In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?\nassistant\n", "To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of ways to arrange the 6 books without any restrictions. Then, we'll subtract the number of arrangements where the 2 math books are next to each other.\n\n<think>\n1. The total number of ways to arrange 6 different books is given by the factorial of 6, which is \\(6!\\).\n2. If the 2 math books are treated as a single unit, we can think of them as a \"super book\". This \"super book\" plus the other 4 books makes 5 units to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 5 units is \\(5!\\). Within the \"super book\", the 2 math books can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways.\n3. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the books such that the math books are next to each other is \\(5! \\times 2!\\).\n4. To find the number of ways the math books are not next to each other, we subtract the number of ways the math books are next to each other from the total number of arrangements.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n<think>\n1. Total number of arrangements of 6 books: \\(6! = 720\\).\n2. Number of ways to arrange the books with the math books next to each other: \\(5! \\times 2! = 120 \\times 2 = 240\\).\n3. Number of ways the math books are not next to each other: \\(720 - 240 = 480\\).\n</think>\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).", 0.8999999761581421]]}
